Aim of the programm was to find values of a,b and c of given function using the ( μ , λ ) evolution strategy

I observed how changing μ and λ changed the needed time, and generation number of the calculations.
I also learned how to implement the Evolution Strategy algorithm, and further increased my ability to use MatLab.
